      <ul>
        <li><u>Respond to 50+ support requests via email every day:</u>While providing support is essential, responding to a high volume of emails daily can be overwhelming and repetitive, leaving less time for other tasks that may be more engaging or impactful.</li>
        <li><u>Help resolve billing issues for customers:</u>Dealing with billing issues can be tedious and complex, involving various policies, procedures, and systems. It requires meticulous attention to detail and patience, but may not always offer the same sense of fulfillment as other tasks.</li>
        <li><u>Dig through logs to troubleshoot a customer's broken project:</u>While troubleshooting technical issues is essential, sifting through logs can be time-consuming and mentally taxing, especially when the problem is challenging to identify or resolve.</li>
        <li><u>Analyze hundreds of support tickets to spot trends the product team can use:</u>Analyzing support tickets to identify trends and patterns is valuable for product improvement, but it can be repetitive and monotonous, requiring careful attention to detail over an extended period.</li>
        <li><u>Scheduling time-off coverage and collaborating as part of a growing cohesive support team:</u>While teamwork and collaboration are essential, administrative tasks such as scheduling time-off coverage may feel less stimulating compared to more customer-facing or strategic activities.</li>
